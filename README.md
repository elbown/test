## Development Environment
Clone the repo with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/storiusApp/storius-app.git
```

Check Flutter with
```bash
flutter doctor
```
and fix warnings/errors it brings up.

Connect an Android/iOS device or emulator with the [Google Play Store installed](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72730948), and run
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run --flavor develop -t lib/main_development.dart # Run Dev Loop 
```

### Android
`flutter run` will probably result in failure. As such, we should add the following line to `android/local.properties`
Create two config files as below in `android/`:
```properties
# other pregenerated properties ...

flutter.minSdkVersion=24
```

Run again
```bash
flutter run --flavor develop -t lib/main_development.dart # Run Dev Loop 
```

## Scripts
Scripts that help the development and build process are found in `scripts/`.
